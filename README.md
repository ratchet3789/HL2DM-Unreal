# HL2DM-Unreal
An early WIP learning project I started to learn Unreals C++ networking system in my spare time.

Currently using Unreal 5.3.x

## Notes
Most of the focus of this project has currently been on strengthening my networking code knowledge so a lot of the actual gameplay elements may be missing or broken.
 - Weapons currently don't work properly
 - Players HUD has not be implemented correctly
 - Only 1 map dm_lockdown, basic blockout
